## 🧠 Introduction

**Swift Retreat** is a customer-focused mobile application designed to simplify and automate the hotel reservation process while adhering to Shariah-compliant principles. The application directly addresses common customer issues like difficulty finding suitable accommodations and lack of real-time availability. Swift Retreat integrates Islamic values, enabling users to easily filter and book accommodations based on criteria such as modesty, family-friendly rooms, and optional amenities like prayer room access and halal-certified food services.
The application is built entirely using the Flutter framework, ensuring a fast, beautiful, and consistent user experience on both iOS and Android devices from a single codebase. 
Customers can intuitively browse and search for available rooms, utilize dynamic filtering for specific Shariah-compliant facilities, view high-quality images and details, and complete secure online reservations directly from their smartphones. Swift Retreat aims to enhance the hotel booking experience by providing a seamless, reliable, and culturally sensitive service for users seeking accommodations in line with Islamic values.
